Linked Lists:
1.	Nodes are: base units; Apple and next, Berry and next, Cherry and next. Data for each node is a string. The head is: LLIST. The tail is the last node in the list which is “Cherry and next”. The arrows are used to reference the next node.

2.	A doubly linked list is a list that has two references, one to the next node and another to previous node. And singly lined lists have one reference which is the next node.

3.	If you keep track of the tail then there’s no need to iterate through the whole list and find the end and then add the item to the end.
